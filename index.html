        <h1>Welcome to Jack Kinker's Biography</h1>
        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 5'11" caucasian male. I enjoy working with computers and listening to music.
            I don't play very many video games, and at the moment, I don't do any sports.
            In my freetime I like to sit around, mindlessly figuring out what to do.
        </p>
        <h2>Some things I do in my freetime:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Play my Skyrim campaign</li>
            <li>Dungeons & Dragons</li>
            <li>Listen to music</li>
            <li>Look at memes</li>
        </ul>
